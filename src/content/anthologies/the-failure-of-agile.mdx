In this talk, Allen Holub argues that the software industry has largely failed to adopt the true principles of agile development. He contends that what most organizations call "agile" is nothing more than a rebranded version of waterfall, complete with excessive ceremony, a focus on processes and tools over individuals and interactions, and a lack of genuine customer collaboration.

Holub advocates for a return to the core values of the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing the importance of delivering working software frequently, embracing change, and fostering a culture of trust and collaboration.
