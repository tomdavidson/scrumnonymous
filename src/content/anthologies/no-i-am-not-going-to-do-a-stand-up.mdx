Allen Holub argues that the daily stand-up, as commonly practiced, is a dysfunctional and wasteful ceremony. He suggests that these meetings often devolve into status reporting for management rather than a forum for team collaboration and problem-solving.

Instead of the traditional stand-up, Holub recommends a continuous, asynchronous approach to communication, where team members are encouraged to talk to each other throughout the day as needed. He also suggests that a well-maintained Kanban board can provide all the necessary visibility into the team's work, making the daily stand-up redundant.
