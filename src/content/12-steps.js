    "title": "Admitting Powerlessness over Ceremonial Overhead",
    "content": "We confess that our lives have become unmanageable: too many boards, too many \"ceremonies,\" and not enough working software. Recognizing that velocity is not a vital sign, we face the awkward truth—our process is sprinting in circles.",

    "title": "Coming to Believe in a Higher Power Called Flow",
    "content": "We acknowledge that **continuous flow**—not two-week chunks of work-in-progress—is capable of restoring sanity. Lean teaches us to keep work small, limit WIP and let value move like tap water instead of dripping from a broken faucet.",

    "number": 3,
    "title": "Turning Our Will Over to the Value Stream",
    "content": "We decide to abandon the Product-Backlog-as-Life-Purpose mindset and instead optimize the *whole* value stream. If a task can't be tied to customer value, it goes to the backlog graveyard—no ceremony required.",

    "title": "Making a Searching and Fearless Waste Inventory",
    "content": "Armed with a Kanban board and a relentless eye, we list every form of waste: partially done work, extra features, hand-offs, context switching, queueing, defects. Yes, that daily thirty-minute \"grooming\" meeting counts as waste, too.",

    "number": 5,
    "title": "Publicly Admitting Our Process Sins",
    "content": "We stand before our team and confess: We treated story points like legal tender. We measured progress by ticket count, not customer outcomes. We treated every sprint review like a Broadway show for stakeholders. Catharsis complete, we shred the last burn-down chart.",

    "number": 6,
    "title": "Becoming Ready to Eliminate Story Points Forever",

    "title": "Humbly Embracing Evidence-Based Forecasting",
    "content": "Out go planning-poker séances; in come **Monte Carlo simulations** run against historical throughput. Forecasts become confidence ranges, not commitments, and management discovers that probability distributions are less embarrassing than missed deadlines.",

    "title": "Continuing Daily Value-Stream Reflection",

We show that Lean is not a cult; it's simply common sense framed as continuous improvement.",
